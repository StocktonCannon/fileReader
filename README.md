# Overview

This is a simple program that allows the user to enter a txt file, enter a string to change, enter a desired string to be changed to, then scans the document and changes those specific strings

This program prompts the user to enter two strings, then passes those to a modifyFile() with a predetermined file path.  These three parameters are then manipulated with the FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader in order to change the predetermined txt file

This is introductory code to highlight the use of document importation and manipulation. 

Youtube video is still not finished... I've been sick with Mono and haven't been able to do a walkthrough

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
